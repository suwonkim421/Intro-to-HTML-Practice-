        <h1>The Chang'e 5 Lunar Mission:</h1>

        <h3>A blog about the discoveries reported</h3><br>
        
        <hr>

        <p>In late 2020, China’s Lunar Exploration Program sent the Chang’e 5 spacecraft to the moon and successfully brought back samples from the lunar surface. From these samples, it was discovered that traces of water, a new mineral, and helium-3 were all present in the moon’s soil. </p>

        <h2>Discoveries and Findings</h2>

        <h3>Significance</h3>

        <p>Chang’e 5 is China’s first lunar sample-return mission. The samples collected are the youngest moon samples ever collected and the first to be returned to Earth since 1976. <a href="#">Read more.</a></p>

        <h3>Water on the Moon</h3>

        <p>Traces of water were found in the samples collected by the Chang’e 5 spacecraft. The water is likely to have come from asteroids and comets that impacted the moon throughout its early history. This water could lead the way towards human colonization of the moon and aid in future space missions. <a href="#">Read more.</a></p>

        <h3>A New Mineral</h3>

        <p>In the samples, a new mineral, named Changesite - (Y), was discovered. Changesite - (Y) is currently the 6th lunar mineral ever found by mankind and is a kind of colorless, transparent columnar crystal. <a href="#">Read more.</a></p>

        <h3>Helium-3 and Nuclear Fusion</h3>

        <p>Helium-3 is a rare isotope of helium with 2 protons and 1 neutron. Helium-3 is currently believed to be a promising fuel for nuclear fusion reactors and a safer alternative to conventional deuterium-tritium reactors. Moon dust is especially rich in helium-3 and harvesting this isotope for energy could be a possibility in the future. <a href="#">Read more.</a></p>
